Stock Market Analysis and Predictor

A comprehensive tool designed for traders, investors, and data enthusiasts to analyze stock market trends, predict future returns, optimize portfolios, and backtest strategies. This project integrates data analysis, machine learning, and market regime detection to provide actionable insights.

Features

1. Data Analysis
Retrieve and preprocess historical stock data using Yahoo Finance.
Analyze key metrics such as:
Daily Returns
Rolling Volatility
Cumulative Returns
Generate visualizations for trends, patterns, and outliers.
Correlation analysis for multiple stocks to understand diversification.
2. Machine Learning Predictions
Predict next-day stock returns using:
Random Forest Regressor for regression tasks.
Evaluate performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualize Actual vs. Predicted Returns for better interpretability.
3. Market Regime Identification
Identify and classify market regimes (e.g., bull and bear markets) using:
K-Means Clustering
Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
Visualize regime shifts over time and their impact on market behavior.
4. Portfolio Optimization
Dynamically adjust portfolio allocations based on identified regimes.
Demonstrate strategy on a sample portfolio of popular stocks (AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT).
Incorporate risk management using volatility predictions.
5. Backtesting
Evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
Compare returns across different periods and regimes.
Use rolling metrics to assess strategy stability.
6. PDF Report Generation
Automatically generate professional reports summarizing:
Data analysis insights
Prediction results
Portfolio performance
Regime analysis
Reports include graphs, key metrics, and textual summaries.
